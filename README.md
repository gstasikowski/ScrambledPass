 - ~~multi-language UI~~
 - ~~calculating password entropy~~
 - ~~user settings panel (default language, load last used word list etc.)~~
 - dynamic language loading (load from file, ability to add custom languages)
 - UI improvements
 - (maybe?) optional clipboard cleaning after copying/cutting from password textbox (see copying passwords in KeepassXC)
