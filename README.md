# ScrambledPass
 Rewrite of the old password generator project with more sensible code structure. 
 
 TODO:
 - ~~implement error handler logic~~
 - ~~warning messages for failed file operations and parsing errors (word and char count boxes)~~
 - multi-language UI
 - calculating password entropy
 - (maybe?) optional clipboard cleaning after copying/cutting from password textbox (see copying passwords in KeepassXC)
